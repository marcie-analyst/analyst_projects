# Marcie Analyst Portfolio
Thank you for viewing my repository. In this repository I have projects in Excel, SQL and R that showcase my abilities to clean data, manipulate data and display my comprehension level of functions respective to Excel, SQL and R.  

## [SQL Project](https://github.com/marcie-analyst/analyst_projects/blob/main/SQL_analysis.md)
In the file SQL_analysis.md you will find the code for SQL as well as the outputs. I used R's library sqldf to write out the SQL commands while R runs them.

## [R Studio Project](https://github.com/marcie-analyst/analyst_projects/blob/main/R_healthcare_analysis.md)
In the file R_healthcare_analysis.md you will find the code using R, which focuses on an analysis in healthcare payor data. The inputs and outputs of the code are displayed in the file.

## [Excel Project](https://github.com/marcie-analyst/analyst_projects/blob/main/Marsh%20Rabbit%20Project.xlsx)
In the file Marsh Rabbit Project.xlsx you will find the link to an excel file (click "view raw") which focuses on demonstrating excel functions in a biological dataset.
